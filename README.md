Do you ever need an old version of redis? I did. That's why I created this.

I needed redis 2.8.18, and I couldn't find a suitable container on docker hub.

Request additional versions or create a PR with them.

Please do not make new software with old versions of redis. I recommend using this when only when historical software demands it.
